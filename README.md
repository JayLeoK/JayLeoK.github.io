This project was a final project for the Web Design Decal course in Fall 2016. It is inspired by the musical genre categorization website Every Noise at Once (everynoise.com). There are three pages to explore:

Select the left button on the home page to try out the Music Mapper, an interface for 'exploring' the dimensions of musical styles. Hover over the four directional buttons to find out what sound you like more. Select a sound type to 'hone in' on a particular genre with roots in any of these four dimensions.

Select the right button to explore a demo of the Thesaurus, a music information & discovery page where you can explore 'related' songs of any artist, album, or genre. Only one result currently works in this demo: search "The Next Episode" to find out more about the song by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg!
